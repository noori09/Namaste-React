Q1. What is the difference between Named export, Default export and * as export?
Ans- If we do default export it is exported by default. We can write export default only once
     in a component. Also, we can rename it in import. But good practice is to use it by same name.
     For ex- export default Title can be imported as import Title from './component/Title'

     Second way is to export by name, named exports use name of a function or a variable as their
     identifier. We can import it by using the same name as it was exported. We can use multiple 
     named export inside any component.
     For ex- export const Title = () =>{} can be imported as import {Title} from './component/Title'

     And if we have multiple exports so we can import it using * as syntax.
     For ex- import * as Obj from  '' and then we can use it like Obj.Title

Q2. What is the importance of config.js file?
Ans- Config file allows developer to customize how to interact with the application. Its a good practice to put
     configured data in as separate file and we usually put all the hardcoded data in our config.js
     file and it can be renamed as constants.js also.
    
Q3. What are React Hooks?
Ans- React Hooks are normal javascript functions which was introduced in React 16.8. They let us use state and other
     React features without writing a class.

Q4. Why do we need a useState Hook?
Ans- If we write a functional component and realize that we need to add some state to it, previously we need to create
     it to a class. Now we can use a hook inside the existing functional component. We can import useState hook using 
     named import from React Library.
