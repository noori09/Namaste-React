Q1. What is a Microservice?
Ans- Instead of having just 1 project we have small small independent projects. Now if we want to change 
     any button we can just deploy 1 UI project. Most of the big applications are built using Microservices
     architecture.


Q2. What is a Monolith architecture?
Ans- Earlier there used to be single big app and that app had everything like APIs, UI, notifications
     etc. and if we have to change any button, we used to deploy whole app. And this architecture is known
     as Monolith.


Q3. What is the difference between Monolith and Microservice?
Ans- A monolithic application is built as a single unified unit while a microservices
     architecture is a collection of smaller, independently deployable services. 


Q4. Why do we need a useEffect hook?
Ans- The useEffect hook allows us to perform side effects in our component. Some ex of side effects
     are fetching data, updating the DOM directly. useEffect is a function, we call this function by 
     passing another function named as callback function inside it. Whenever a component renders, 
     it will call the function which we passed inside our useEffect. If we don't want to call it after
     every render we can pass dependency array as a second parameter to our useEffect. We can import 
     useEffect by using named import from React Library.


Q5. What is Optional Chaining?
Ans- The optional chaining operator accesses an object's property or calls a function. If the object
     accessed or the function called is undefined or null, it returns undefined instead of throwing an
     error.


Q6. What is Shimmer UI?
Ans- A shimmer UI resembels the page's actual UI, so user will get an idea of what's about to come and
     what's happening when a page full of content/data takes more than 3-5 seconds.


Q7. What is the difference between JS expression and JS statement?
Ans- An expression can be assigned or used as operands, while statements can only be declared.


Q8. What is conditional rendering? Explain with code example.
Ans- Depending on the state value we can render some component. For ex- const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(false)
     so, in render() method we can add conditional rendering like
      {isLoggedIn? 
            <RenderComponentA></RenderComponentA>
            :
            <RenderComponentB></RenderComponentB>}  


Q9. What is CORS?
Ans- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is a system, consisting of transmitting HTTP headers, that determines
     whether browsers block frontend Javascript code from accessing responses for cross-origin requests.


Q10. What is async and await?
Ans- async and await make promises easier to write. 
     async makes a function return a promise.
     await makes a function wait for a promise.
     The keyword async before a function makes the function return a promise.The await keyword can only be
     used inside an async function.The await keyword makes the function pause the execution and wait
     for a resolved promise before it continues 



Q11. What is the use of const json = await data.json() in getRestaurants()?
Ans- fetch basically returns readable stream and that readable stream needs to be converted into json object
     so that we can read it.
